;On getting the available movements after the first click, I will recolor the available movements to blue
;in defGrid and initGrid. On moving the arrowPointer over the available moves,
;the green color should overwrite the blue color,so the green color would be written in initGrid .
;When the arrowPointer leaves one available move, I need it to be recolored to blue not white or grey
;so I need an intermediate grid that contains the blue color always after click which is defGrid.
;When the arrowPointer leaves the old position of available moves, initGrid would be compared to defGrid
;so that the blue colored cells would be redrawn.

;If we don't use defGrid and compared it directly to stdGrid then when the arrow leaves a blue cell
;it would be recolored to grey or white not blue
